  # ONF specific FAQ
  utter_faq/enterprise:
    - text: Enterprise forms the root of a customer-specific Enterprise hierarchy. The Enterprise model is referenced by many other objects, and allows those objects to be scoped to a particular Enterprise for ownership and role-based access control purposes.

  utter_faq/application:
    - text: Application specifies an application and the endpoints for the application. Applications are the termination point for traffic from the UPF.

  utter_faq/slice:
    - text: Slice connects a Device-Group to an Application.

  utter_faq/device_group:
    - text: Device-Group allows multiple devices to be logically grouped together.

  utter_faq/site:
    - text: Enterprises are divided into Sites. A site is a point of presence for an Enterprise and may be either physical or logical (i.e. a single geographic location could in theory contain several logical sites).
